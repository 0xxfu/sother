## [Low] Unsafe downcasting arithmetic operation

### description

Downcasting from uint256/int256 in Solidity does not revert on overflow.
When a type is downcast to a smaller type, the higher order bits are truncated, 
effectively applying a modulo to the original value. 
Without any other checks, this wrapping will lead to unexpected behavior and bugs.


**There are `7` instances of this issue:**

- [ui128 = uint128(a)](solidity/tmp/unsafe_casting.sol#L16) should use `uint256/int256` or `OpenZeppelin SafeCast lib`.
- [ui32 = uint32(block.timestamp)](solidity/tmp/unsafe_casting.sol#L18) should use `uint256/int256` or `OpenZeppelin SafeCast lib`.
- [Transmitted(uint32(uint256(a >> 8)))](solidity/tmp/unsafe_casting.sol#L20) should use `uint256/int256` or `OpenZeppelin SafeCast lib`.
- [uint32(a)](solidity/tmp/unsafe_casting.sol#L24) should use `uint256/int256` or `OpenZeppelin SafeCast lib`.
- [ui128 = uint128(uint64(a))](solidity/tmp/unsafe_casting.sol#L78) should use `uint256/int256` or `OpenZeppelin SafeCast lib`.
- [ui32 = uint32(uint64(block.timestamp))](solidity/tmp/unsafe_casting.sol#L80) should use `uint256/int256` or `OpenZeppelin SafeCast lib`.
- [uint32(uint8(a))](solidity/tmp/unsafe_casting.sol#L84) should use `uint256/int256` or `OpenZeppelin SafeCast lib`.

### recommendation

Just use `uint256/int256`, or use [OpenZeppelin SafeCast lib](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/math/SafeCast.sol#).

## [Low] Double type casts create complexity within the code

### description

Double type casting should be avoided in Solidity contracts to prevent unintended 
consequences and ensure accurate data representation. 
Performing multiple type casts in succession can lead to unexpected truncation, 
rounding errors, or loss of precision, potentially compromising the contract's 
functionality and reliability. Furthermore, double type casting can make the code 
less readable and harder to maintain, increasing the likelihood of errors and 
misunderstandings during development and debugging. To ensure precise and consistent 
data handling, developers should use appropriate data types and avoid unnecessary 
or excessive type casting, promoting a more robust and dependable contract execution.


**There are `4` instances of this issue:**

- [Transmitted(uint32(uint256(a >> 8)))](solidity/tmp/unsafe_casting.sol#L20) should use single casting instead of double casting.

- [ui128 = uint128(uint64(a))](solidity/tmp/unsafe_casting.sol#L78) should use single casting instead of double casting.

- [ui32 = uint32(uint64(block.timestamp))](solidity/tmp/unsafe_casting.sol#L80) should use single casting instead of double casting.

- [uint32(uint8(a))](solidity/tmp/unsafe_casting.sol#L84) should use single casting instead of double casting.


### recommendation

Consider using single casting instead of double casting.

## [Low] Setters should check the input value

### description

Setters should have initial value check to prevent assigning wrong value to the variable. 
Assignment of wrong value can lead to unexpected behavior of the contract.

## [Low] Events are missing sender information

### description

When an action is triggered based on a user's action, not being able to filter based on 
who triggered the action makes event processing a lot more cumbersome. 
Including the `msg.sender` the events of these types of action will make events much more 
useful to end users.



**There is `1` instance of this issue:**

- [Transmitted(uint32(uint256(a >> 8)))](solidity/tmp/unsafe_casting.sol#L20) should add `msg.sender` to event.

## [Informational] Incorrect versions of Solidity

### description

`solc` frequently releases new compiler versions. Using an old version prevents access to new Solidity security checks.
We also recommend avoiding complex `pragma` statement.

**There is `1` instance of this issue:**

- solc-0.8.17 is not recommended for deployment


### recommendation

Deploy with any of the following Solidity versions:
- 0.8.21

The recommendations take into account:
- Risks related to recent releases
- Risks of complex code generation changes
- Risks of new language features
- Risks of known bugs

Use a simple pragma version that allows any of these versions.
Consider using the latest version of Solidity for testing.

## [Informational] Unnecessary Public Function Modifier

### description
Detect the public function which can be replaced with external

**There are `2` instances of this issue:**

- function:[UnsafeDowncast.bad2(uint128)](solidity/tmp/unsafe_casting.sol#L23-L25)is public and can be replaced with external 

- function:[UnsafeDoubleCast.bad2(uint128)](solidity/tmp/unsafe_casting.sol#L83-L85)is public and can be replaced with external 

#### Exploit scenario

```solidity
contract A{}
contract B is A{
    constructor() public A(){}
}
```
When reading `B`'s constructor definition, we might assume that `A()` initiates the contract, but no code is executed.

## [Optimization] Usage of `uints`/`ints` smaller than 32 bytes (256 bits) incurs overhead

### description

> When using elements that are smaller than 32 bytes, your contractâ€™s gas usage may be higher. This is because the EVM operates on 32 bytes at a time. Therefore, if the element is smaller than that, the EVM must use more operations in order to reduce the size of the element from 32 bytes to the desired size.

More detail see [this.](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/internals/layout_in_storage.html)

Each operation involving a `uint8` costs an extra [**22-28 gas**](https://gist.github.com/0xxfu/3672fec07eb3031cd5da14ac015e04a1) (depending on whether the other operand is also a variable of type `uint8`) as compared to ones involving `uint256`, due to the compiler having to clear the higher bits of the memory word before operating on the `uint8`, as well as the associated stack operations of doing so. Use a larger size then downcast where needed


**There are `13` instances of this issue:**

- `uint128 `[UnsafeDowncast.ui128](solidity/tmp/unsafe_casting.sol#L3) should be used `uint256/int256`.

## [Optimization] Remove or replace unused state variables

### description

Saves a storage slot. If the variable is assigned a non-zero value, 
saves Gsset (20000 gas). If it's assigned a zero value, saves Gsreset (2900 gas). 
If the variable remains unassigned, there is no gas savings unless the variable is public, 
in which case the compiler-generated non-payable getter deployment cost is saved. 
If the state variable is overriding an interface's public function, 
mark the variable as constant or immutable so that it does not use a storage slot

## [Optimization] Use indexed events for value types as they are less costly compared to non-indexed ones

### description

Using the `indexed` keyword for [value types](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/types.html#value-types) (`bool/int/address/string/bytes`) saves gas costs, as seen in [this example](https://gist.github.com/0xxfu/c292a65ecb61cae6fd2090366ea0877e).

However, this is only the case for value types, whereas indexing [reference types](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.20/types.html#reference-types) (`array/struct`) are more expensive than their unindexed version.


**There is `1` instance of this issue:**
