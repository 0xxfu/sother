## [Medium] Return values of `transfer()/transferFrom()` not checked

### description

Not all `IERC20` implementations `revert()` when there's a failure in `transfer()`/`transferFrom()`. The function signature has a `boolean` return value and they indicate errors that way instead. By not checking the return value, operations that should have marked as failed, may potentially go through without actually making a payment.


**There are `2` instances of this issue:**

- [C.bad0()](solidity/tmp/unused_return_transfers.sol#L20-L22) ignores return value by [t.transfer(address(0),1000000000000000000)](solidity/tmp/unused_return_transfers.sol#L21)

- [C.bad1()](solidity/tmp/unused_return_transfers.sol#L40-L42) ignores return value by [t.transferFrom(address(this),address(0),1000000000000000000)](solidity/tmp/unused_return_transfers.sol#L41)

#### Exploit scenario

```solidity
contract Token {
    function transferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _value) public returns (bool success);
}
contract MyBank{  
    mapping(address => uint) balances;
    Token token;
    function deposit(uint amount) public{
        token.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        balances[msg.sender] += amount;
    }
}
```
Several tokens do not revert in case of failure and return false. If one of these tokens is used in `MyBank`, `deposit` will not revert if the transfer fails, and an attacker can call `deposit` for free..

### recommendation
Use `SafeERC20`, or ensure that the transfer/transferFrom return value is checked.

## [Medium] Unsafe use of `transfer()/transferFrom()` with IERC20

### description

Some tokens do not implement the ERC20 standard properly but are still accepted by most code 
that accepts ERC20 tokens. For example Tether (USDT)'s `transfer()` and `transferFrom()` functions 
on L1 do not return booleans as the specification requires, and instead have no return value. 
When these sorts of tokens are cast to IERC20, their [function signatures](https://medium.com/coinmonks/missing-return-value-bug-at-least-130-tokens-affected-d67bf08521ca) 
do not match and therefore the calls made, revert.


**There are `12` instances of this issue:**

### recommendation

Use [OpenZeppelinâ€™s SafeERC20](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol) 
`safeTransfer()/safeTransferFrom()` instead of `transfer()/transferFrom()`

## [Medium] Unused return

### description
The return value of an external call is not stored in a local or state variable.

**There is `1` instance of this issue:**

- [C.good10()](solidity/tmp/unused_return_transfers.sol#L60-L62) ignores return value by [t.other()](solidity/tmp/unused_return_transfers.sol#L61)

#### Exploit scenario

```solidity
contract MyConc{
    using SafeMath for uint;   
    function my_func(uint a, uint b) public{
        a.add(b);
    }
}
```
`MyConc` calls `add` of `SafeMath`, but does not store the result in `a`. As a result, the computation has no effect.

### recommendation
Ensure that all the return values of the function calls are used.

## [Low] `revert CustomError()` should be used instead of `assert()`

### description

Prior to solidity version 0.8.0, hitting an assert consumes the **remainder of the 
transaction's available gas** rather than returning it, as `require()`/`revert()` do. 
`assert()` should be avoided even past solidity version 0.8.0 as its 
[documentation](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/control-structures.html#panic-via-assert-and-error-via-require) 
states that "The assert function creates an error of type Panic(uint256). ... 
Properly functioning code should never create a Panic, not even on invalid external 
input. If this happens, then there is a bug in your contract which you should fix.



**There are `2` instances of this issue:**

- [assert(bool)(t.transfer(address(0),1000000000000000000))](solidity/tmp/unused_return_transfers.sol#L30) should be replaced by `if (!condition) revert CustomError();`.

- [assert(bool)(t.transferFrom(address(this),address(0),1000000000000000000))](solidity/tmp/unused_return_transfers.sol#L50) should be replaced by `if (!condition) revert CustomError();`.

Please use `if (!condition) revert CustomError();` instead of `assert()`.

## [Low] Functions calling contracts/addresses with transfer hooks are missing reentrancy guards

### description

Even if the function follows the best practice of check-effects-interaction, 
not using a reentrancy guard when there may be transfer hooks will open the 
users of this protocol up to 
[read-only reentrancies](https://chainsecurity.com/curve-lp-oracle-manipulation-post-mortem/) 
with no way to protect against it, except by block-listing the whole protocol.


**There are `12` instances of this issue:**

## [Informational] Incorrect versions of Solidity

### description

`solc` frequently releases new compiler versions. Using an old version prevents access to new Solidity security checks.
We also recommend avoiding complex `pragma` statement.

**There is `1` instance of this issue:**

- solc-0.8.17 is not recommended for deployment


### recommendation

Deploy with any of the following Solidity versions:
- 0.8.21

The recommendations take into account:
- Risks related to recent releases
- Risks of complex code generation changes
- Risks of new language features
- Risks of known bugs

Use a simple pragma version that allows any of these versions.
Consider using the latest version of Solidity for testing.

## [Optimization] State variables only set in the constructor should be declared immutable

### description

Avoids a Gsset (20000 gas) in the constructor, and replaces the first access in each transaction (Gcoldsload - 2100 gas) and each access thereafter (Gwarmacces - 100 gas) with a PUSH32 (3 gas).

While strings are not value types, and therefore cannot be immutable/constant if not hard-coded outside of the constructor, the same behavior can be achieved by making the current contract abstract with virtual functions for the string accessors, and having a child contract override the functions with the hard-coded implementation-specific values.
    

**There is `1` instance of this issue:**

- [C.t](solidity/tmp/unused_return_transfers.sol#L13) should be immutable

## [Optimization] Using custom errors replace `require` or `assert`

### description

Using a custom error instance will usually be much cheaper than a string description, because you can use the name of the error to describe it, which is encoded in only four bytes. A longer description can be supplied via NatSpec which does not incur any costs.

More detail see [this](https://gist.github.com/0xxfu/712f7965446526f8c5bc53a91d97a215) and [this](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/control-structures.html#revert).

## [Optimization] Amounts should be checked for `0` before calling a `transfer`

### recommendation

Consider adding a non-zero-value check at the beginning of function.

## [Optimization] Setting the constructor to `payable`

### description

You can cut out 10 opcodes in the creation-time EVM bytecode 
if you declare a constructor `payable`. 
Making the constructor `payable` eliminates the need for an initial check 
of `msg.value == 0` and saves `13 gas` on deployment with no security risks.


**There is `1` instance of this issue:**

- [C.constructor()](solidity/tmp/unused_return_transfers.sol#L15-L17) should be set to `payable` 


### recommendation

Set the constructor to `payable`.
