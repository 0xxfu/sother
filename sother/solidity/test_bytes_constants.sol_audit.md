## [Informational] Incorrect versions of Solidity

### description:

`solc` frequently releases new compiler versions. Using an old version prevents access to new Solidity security checks.
We also recommend avoiding complex `pragma` statement.

**There is `1` instance of this issue:**

- solc-0.8.19 is not recommended for deployment


### recommendation:

Deploy with any of the following Solidity versions:
- 0.8.20

The recommendations take into account:
- Risks related to recent releases
- Risks of complex code generation changes
- Risks of new language features
- Risks of known bugs

Use a simple pragma version that allows any of these versions.
Consider using the latest version of Solidity for testing.

## [Optimization] `Bytes` constants are more efficient than `string` constants

### description:

From the [Solidity doc](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/types.html#arrays):
> If you can limit the length to a certain number of bytes, 
> always use one of the value types `bytes1` to `bytes32` because they are much cheaper.

[Why do Solidity examples use bytes32 type instead of string?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/3795/why-do-solidity-examples-use-bytes32-type-instead-of-string)

`bytes32` uses less gas because it fits in a single word of the EVM, 
and `string` is a dynamically sized-type which has current limitations in Solidity 
(such as canâ€™t be returned from a function to a contract).

If data can fit into 32 bytes, then you should use `bytes32` datatype rather than `bytes` or `strings`
 as it is cheaper in solidity. 
 Basically, any fixed size variable in solidity is cheaper than variable size. 
 That will save gas on the contract.


**There is `1` instance of this issue:**

- `BytesConstants.bad` (solidity/test_bytes_constants.sol#L2) should use `bytes(1..31)` instead of `string`.


### recommendation:

Replace `string` constant with `bytes(1..32)` constant.

## [Optimization] Using `private` rather than `public` for constants, saves gas

### description:

If needed, the values can be read from the verified contract source code, or if there are multiple values there can be a single getter function that [returns a tuple](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-08-frax/blob/90f55a9ce4e25bceed3a74290b854341d8de6afa/src/contracts/FraxlendPair.sol#L156-L178) of the values of all currently-public constants. 

Saves **3406-3606 gas** in deployment gas due to the compiler not having to create non-payable getter functions for deployment calldata, not having to store the bytes of the value outside of where it's used, and not adding another entry to the method ID table


**There are `2` instances of this issue:**

- `BytesConstants.bad` (solidity/test_bytes_constants.sol#L2) should be used `private` visibility to save gas.

- `BytesConstants.notBad` (solidity/test_bytes_constants.sol#L3) should be used `private` visibility to save gas.


### recommendation:

Using `private` replace `public` with constant.
