    WIKI_DESCRIPTION = """
Some tokens (e.g. `UNI`, `COMP`) revert if the value passed to `approve` or `transfer` 
is larger than `uint96`.

Both of the above tokens have special case logic in `approve` that sets `allowance` 
to `type(uint96).max` if the `approval` amount is `uint256(-1)`, which may cause 
issues with systems that expect the value passed to `approve` to be reflected in 
the allowances mapping.

Approving the maximum value of `uint256` is a known practice to save gas. 
However, this pattern was proven to increase the impact of an attack many times in the past, 
in case the approved contract gets hacked.
"""

    WIKI_RECOMMENDATION = """
Consider approving the exact amount thatâ€™s needed to be transferred 
instead of the `type(uint256).max` amount.
