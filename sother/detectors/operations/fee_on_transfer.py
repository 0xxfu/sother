    WIKI_DESCRIPTION = """
Some ERC20 tokens make modifications to the standard implementations of
their ERC20â€™s `transfer` or `balanceOf` functions.
One type of such token is deflationary tokens that charge a fee on every
`transfer()` and `transferFrom()`.
The protocol does not have incompatibility with fee-on-transfer tokens.

Note that there has been a real-world exploit related to this with 
[Balancer pool and STA deflationary tokens](https://medium.com/1inch-network/balancer-hack-2020-a8f7131c980e).
"""
    WIKI_EXPLOIT_SCENARIO = """
i.e. Fee-on-transfer scenario:
1. Contract calls transfer from contractA 100 tokens to current contract
2. Current contract thinks it received 100 tokens
3. It updates balances to increase +100 tokens
4. While actually contract received only 90 tokens
5. That breaks whole math for given token
"""

    WIKI_RECOMMENDATION = """
1. Consider comparing before and after balance to get the actual transferred amount.
2. Alternatively, disallow tokens with fee-on-transfer mechanics to be added as tokens.
