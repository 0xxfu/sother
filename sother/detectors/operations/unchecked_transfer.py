Not all `IERC20` implementations `revert()` when there's a failure in `transfer()`/`transferFrom()`. The function signature has a `boolean` return value and they indicate errors that way instead.

Some tokens do not implement the ERC20 standard properly but are still accepted by most code 
that accepts ERC20 tokens. For example Tether (USDT)'s `transfer()` and `transferFrom()` functions 
on L1 do not return booleans as the specification requires, and instead have no return value. 
When these sorts of tokens are cast to IERC20, their [function signatures](https://medium.com/coinmonks/missing-return-value-bug-at-least-130-tokens-affected-d67bf08521ca) 
do not match and therefore the calls made, revert.
