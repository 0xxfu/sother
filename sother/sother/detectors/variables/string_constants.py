    WIKI_DESCRIPTION = """
From the [Solidity doc](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/types.html#arrays):
> If you can limit the length to a certain number of bytes, 
> always use one of the value types `bytes1` to `bytes32` because they are much cheaper.

[Why do Solidity examples use bytes32 type instead of string?](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/3795/why-do-solidity-examples-use-bytes32-type-instead-of-string)

`bytes32` uses less gas because it fits in a single word of the EVM, 
and `string` is a dynamically sized-type which has current limitations in Solidity 
(such as canâ€™t be returned from a function to a contract).

If data can fit into 32 bytes, then you should use `bytes32` datatype rather than `bytes` or `strings`
 as it is cheaper in solidity. 
 Basically, any fixed size variable in solidity is cheaper than variable size. 
 That will save gas on the contract.
"""
    WIKI_RECOMMENDATION = """
Replace `string` constant with `bytes(1..32)` constant.
