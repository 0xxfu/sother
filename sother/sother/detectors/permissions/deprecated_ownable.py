    WIKI_DESCRIPTION = """
The current ownership transfer process for all the contracts inheriting
from `Ownable` or `OwnableUpgradeable` involves the current owner calling the
[transferOwnership()](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v4.8/contracts/access/Ownable.sol#L69-L72) function:

```
    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public virtual onlyOwner {
        require(newOwner != address(0), "Ownable: new owner is the zero address");
        _transferOwnership(newOwner);
    }
```
If the nominated EOA account is not a valid account, it is entirely possible
that the owner may accidentally transfer ownership to an uncontrolled
account, losing the access to all functions with the `onlyOwner` modifier.

"""

    WIKI_RECOMMENDATION = """
It is recommended to implement a two-step process where the owner nominates
an account and the nominated account needs to call an `acceptOwnership()`
function for the transfer of the ownership to fully succeed. This ensures
the nominated EOA account is a valid and active account. This can be
easily achieved by using OpenZeppelinâ€™s [Ownable2Step](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/release-v4.8/contracts/access/Ownable2Step.sol) contract instead of
`Ownable`:

```
abstract contract Ownable2Step is Ownable {

    /**
     * @dev Starts the ownership transfer of the contract to a new account. Replaces the pending transfer if there is one.
     * Can only be called by the current owner.
     */
    function transferOwnership(address newOwner) public virtual override onlyOwner {
        _pendingOwner = newOwner;
        emit OwnershipTransferStarted(owner(), newOwner);
    }
    
    ...

    /**
     * @dev The new owner accepts the ownership transfer.
     */
    function acceptOwnership() external {
        address sender = _msgSender();
        require(pendingOwner() == sender, "Ownable2Step: caller is not the new owner");
        _transferOwnership(sender);
    }
}
